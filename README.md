# About FPS
This game runs at 60 FPS. While the original Club Penguin ran its minigames at 24 FPS, Club Penguin Rewritten has always run them at 30, resulting in the game running 25% faster than normal. This game was initially developed for CPR, and thus I have modelled the physics in my version after the version that CPR would use. This was done by taking the original Flash code, and editing things like the gravity to be half their original values, while doubling others. To learn more about minigames and FPS, I recommend looking at this post on the Club Penguin section of speedrun.com: https://www.speedrun.com/cp/thread/t8ydm#ch4_What_is_up_with_the_FPS_
